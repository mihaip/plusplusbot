M4:
- random target/user link
- support pre-increment
- use border for hover underline in title since it's too thick on windows/linux
- require at least one ascii character in target names (to handle mosh's 
  message)
- faq
- me too links
- feedback link on every page
- auto-linkify non-http URLs like erica's www.bofa.mobi
- user icon on target -> user links and score rounded corners + colors on 
  user -> target links
- escape <'s in target names and/or ignore messages like 
  http://twitter.com/todesking/statuses/89832842

DONE:
- better parsing when skipping over standalone signs (e.g. in
  http://twitter.com/beergeek/statuses/78512872)
- detect when targets are usernames (and vice-versa) and display accordingly
- unicode support in reasons
- unicode support in target names
- feedback link
- every N (20?) refreshes don't use a since parameter to catch out of order
  messages
- normalize target names (e.g. / to -) when picking the target name, not
  when deciding on the file name
- spaces in target names via parentheses
- blacklist C++, etc.
- op-crowding
- better feed item IDs for ops that come from the same message
- don't crowd ops for just two
- limit feed to 20 items too
- link rel="alternate" type="text/html" for feeds
- more explicit (both ++ and --) examples on front page (on their own lines) 
- rss feed for clique actions
- nofollow URLs
- on hover show the entire original message
- store checkpoint as epoch timestamps and format it for the since parameter
- plusplusbot shouldn't have both boosters and detractors when it's at 10 people
- limit caching to 60 seconds
- investigate why kushal has no friends
- see why krave doesn't show up in dbentley's friends list
- move username/pass to command line arguments
- plusplus-ing from hompage
- re-use stale cache data for object cache

M5:
- target autocomplete for form
- op frequency chart on per user and per target pages for last 24 hours/week/
  30 days
- on target page, have ++/-- minus buttons that generate a pre-filled direct 
  message to plusplusbot
- send public update with fast risers/fallers
- rate limiting (same user/target pair over a 5 minute span)
- live scroller on homepage
- Analytics tracking
- move all paths to command line arguments
- use op recency as tie-breaker when sorting scores
- handle <, >, (, ), [, ], *this, it's in target names (bad when uploading 
  because of shell escaping)
- truncate long target names like mark_bittman_10_minute_pancakes (and move to 
  tooltip)
- starring of favorite ++'s and --'s
- better favicon
- add json(p) support for front page, target, user
- support alternate t9 friendly syntax for direct messages like 
  "dtussey minus for foo bar"
- generate most active today chart

  http://davidbau.com/archives/2007/02/18/python_templates.html
  http://davidbau.com/archives/2007/03/11/python_string_functions.html
- scp to plusplusbot.com
- log created_at checkpoint and use that for since

M1:
- show recent ops on landing page
- anonymize direct messages
- log bad JSON responses
- use dan's twitter account when loading partychat logs
- handle bad JSON responses that trigger exceptions
- fix relative dates
- add last updated timestamp to landing page
- generate per-target page with:
  - reasons
  - recent activity
  - top users (for both ++ and --)
- add .htaccess saying the default mime type is text/html
- generate per-user page:
  - top targets (negative and positive)
  - recent activity
- relative timestamps for debug messages
- basic howto on landing page
- why is "test" (with +22) not in the top of most adored?
- make direct messages not anonymous unless they start with !
- scp only update_set

M2:
- sleep for 60 - iteration_time
- don't link to direct messages in timestamp
- send confirmation/update direct message after processing op
- shrinking text in IE
- icon for user (in both page title and links) to help differentiate from targets
- cache profile image urls and use them
- faster uploads (use single scp command per directory)
- better formatting for per target page
- make front page line up better (like target page)
- make user pages line up better
- trim confirmation direct message (don't include reason)
- redirect from www.plusplusbot.com to plusplusbot.com
- real logo
- replace "--" and "++" in ack with "minusminus" and "plusplus"
- use measure map style big font sentence headers:
  - dolapo has ++'ed NN times, --'ed NN times, about NN things
  - google has been ++'ed by NN people, --'ed by NN people, for a total score of
    N
- anonymous ops are still counted on user pages
- icon for anymous usage
- add total op and distinct user count to landing page
- flags for no upload/run once/no twitter data
- faster recovery with no_rebuild flag
- no top boosters for < 5 messages in activity
- handle standalone use of -- and ++ in a message (don't generate op)
- title not lining up in Firefox/Windows

M3:
- handle httplib.BadStatusLine exception
- get friends for users (with 1 day cache) and generate "with friends" section 
  on user page
- auto-link URLs
- link from "with friends" section to the user's friends (just icons?)
- add atom feeds for front page, target, user
- validate response is valid JSON before caching it
- better layout for "with friends"/"clique mode" section
- move homepage recent activity above least/most columns
- favicon
- fix newlines in messages like dbentleys
- maintain local copies of .htaccess and robots.txt
- better wording for clique mode: "ak and their 4 friends (icons) have ++'ed..."
- tooltips on user links with full name
